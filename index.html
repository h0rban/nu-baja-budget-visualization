    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>For this project, we used financial data from the Northeastern Motorsports Club to visualize a breakdown of their
        yearly budget by funding sources, and also show where they are spending the most money by budget category. We
        used three different bar chart variations to display a budget summary for the NU Motorsports Club. For
        technology, we mainly used D3 to create our visualizations.

        GitHub repository.</p>

    <h1>Interaction Instructions</h1>
    <p>The first and third visualizations are linked to the second visualization.
        Please interact with the second bar chart in order to affect the other 2.
        To select multiple funding sources at a time please "shift + click" the bars.
        A shortcut to reload the selection is clicking anywhere on the vis except the bars or click on the total
        bar.</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    <p>Our visualization is compiled of 3 different major components. The first visualization is a ‘fuel gauge’ bar
        (horizontal stacked bar chart) representing the total budget. The second visualization is several smaller fuel
        gauges (proportional bar charts) representing each of the budget’s funding sources. The third visualization is a
        couple of bar charts (proportional bar charts) representing what budget categories the money from the selected
        funding sources was spent on.</p>
    <p>We have included multiple features to make the charts more interactive. Firstly, hovering over any of the bars
        reveals a tooltip that provides additional information for the specific bar users are hovering over. We thought
        that offering details on demand would be a quick way to give readers the details on specific areas of the
        visualizations. Secondly, clicking on the bars in the “Funding Sources” chart selects the data that was clicked
        on.
        Shift+ clicking on the bars allows users to select multiple funding sources simultaneously for collective
        comparison if needed. When a funding source is selected, the associated bar remains blue while non-selected
        sources change to a grey color. We did this so users could identify which sources are selected and which aren’t.
        The second visualization is linked to the first visualization as well as the third. The selection of bars in the
        second visualization updates the first visualization to show how much of the current budget is being used by the
        selected funding sources. This is visually apparent because the money in the budget contributed by the selected
        funding sources is highlighted in blue. Simultaneously, the rest of the bar turns grey to make it visually
        apparent to users. Selecting bars in the second visualization updates the third visualization and displays the
        proportion of the money spent in each budget category. If more than one funding source is selected, the
        resulting
        visualization will show the budget category breakdown for multiple funding sources together.</p>

    <p>When creating the visualizations, we needed to make specific choices about what to include in the
        visualizations. We changed our mind about using a pie chart to represent the budget categories and used a
        percentage bar chart for the last chart because we needed to indicate when no purchases were made in a
        particular budget category. One of the most important ones we made was that we did not use multicolored bars in
        order to avoid the complexity of the visualization. Since we are mainly focused on bars, we were wary that
        having them be multicolored may confuse users and make them think there is a correlation between color and the
        bars that would not have been there. We also added small animations so that, when data is selected, users can
        see the visualizations move up and down like fuel gauges. </p>
