# NU Baja Budget Visualization

Service-Learning Course Project as part of
[DS 4200 F20: Information Visualization](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781732), taught by
[Prof. Cody Dunne](https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/),
[Data Visualization @ Khoury](https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/),
[Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

For this project, we used financial data from the Northeastern Motorsports Club to visualize a breakdown of their yearly
budget by funding sources, and also show where they are spending the most money by budget category. We used three
different bar chart variations to display a budget summary for the NU Motorsports Club. For technology, we mainly used
D3 to create our visualizations. Github
